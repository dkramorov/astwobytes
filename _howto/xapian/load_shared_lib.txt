#Libraries have been installed in:
#   /home/jocker/django/xapian/hunspell/lib
#If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
#in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
#specify the full pathname of the library, or use the `-LLIBDIR'
#flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
#   - add LIBDIR to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
#     during execution
#   - add LIBDIR to the `LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
#     during linking
#   - use the `-Wl,-rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
#   - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to `/etc/ld.so.conf'
