AttributeError at /

'MSetItem' object has no attribute 'get_document'

It seems like the method get_document() used in ResultSet in Djapian is outdated in the newest release of Xapian (I think 1.2.2), along with get_percent(), get_weight(), and many other of these functions.

Instead, Xapian is using self.document instead of self.get_document().

The error message is often:
'MSetItem' object has no attribute 'get_document'

To correct that, just modify the file resultset.py in the root directory where Djapian was installed so it uses 'doc = self.document', 'percent = self.percent' and etc.
