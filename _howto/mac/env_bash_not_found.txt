This is because the gradlew file has Windows file-endings.

You can install dos2unix with apt-get or yum by running:

sudo apt-get install dos2unix

sudo yum install -y dos2unix
and then use dos2unix to convert the line-endings

from CRLF Windows CarriageReturn + LineFeed

to LF Linux LineFeed only:

dos2unix ./gradlew
Then run your gradlew for a test:

./gradlew clean -d
