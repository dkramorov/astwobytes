So here are the steps:

Download the latest trial version of Sketch.
Close Sketch. Even if it shows the Trial Expired screen it will ease any hassles of this trick not working.

Don’t open Sketch up until you’ve followed Steps 3 to 6.

Opening Terminal (If you don’t know how to do this, then it’s best you don’t continue).

Copy and paste text in red into your the terminal window, then press enter:
sudo rm -rf ~/Library/Application Support/com.bohncoding.sketch3; echo '185.27.174.169\tlocalhost' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts > /dev/null
Note: You will need to enter in your password, but don’t worry if you don’t see anything on the screen. Just be sure to press enter after you’ve typed it in.

Copy and paste text in red into your the terminal window, then press enter again:
cat /etc/hosts

If you see 185.27.174.169 localhost on your screen then it means you can continue to Step 8, if not try Step 5 and 6 again, else drop me a comment.

Open up Sketch, and you shouldn’t see any trial window, or even the days remaining if you press OK on the Welcome to Sketch screen.

If Sketch has helped you out, and you can afford it, it’s just $99 for a tool that saves you a whole lot of time and money compared to other solutions on the market.

Enjoy using Sketch!
