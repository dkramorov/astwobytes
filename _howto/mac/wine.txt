wine-stable supports both 32-bit and 64-bit. It is compatible with an existing
32-bit wine prefix, but it will now default to 64-bit when you create a new
wine prefix. The architecture can be selected using the WINEARCH environment
variable which can be set to either win32 or win64.

To create a new pure 32-bit prefix, you can run:
  $ WINEARCH=win32 WINEPREFIX=~/.wine32 winecfg
