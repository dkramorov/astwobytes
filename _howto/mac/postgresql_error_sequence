Since PostgreSQL 8.2 you have to use:

GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCE cities_id_seq TO www;

GRANT USAGE - For sequences, this privilege allows the use of the currval and nextval functions.

Also you can grant permissions to all the sequences in the schema with:

GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO www;



postgres=# GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO postgres;
GRANT
