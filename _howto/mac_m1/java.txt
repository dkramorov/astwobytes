In $JRE/lib/security/java.security:
у меня это /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-11.jdk/Contents/Home/conf/security/java.security
jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, TLSv1, RC4, DES, MD5withRSA, DH keySize < 1024, \
EC keySize < 224, 3DES_EDE_CBC, anon, NULL

This line is enabled, after I commented out this line, everything is working fine. Apparently after/in jre1.8.0_181 this line is enabled.

The problem also appears with the latest openjdk 11 versions (11.0.11+9-0ubuntu2~18.04). What I don't understand is, why don't java and mysql just agree on using TLSv1.2, since both parties seem to support it? Also, just patching the java.security file isn't a long term solution, what's the way forward with this issue?

-Djava.security.properties=${PATH_TO_FILE?}/custom.java.security
jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3, TLSv1.1, RC4, DES, MD5withRSA, \
    DH keySize < 1024, EC keySize < 224, 3DES_EDE_CBC, anon, NULL, \
    include jdk.disabled.namedCurves
I removed TLSv1 from the list.



LINUX
In my case I am runnig Centos 8 and had the same issue with Imap/Java. Had to update the system-wide cryptographic policy level.
    update-crypto-policies --set LEGACY
    reboot machine.

Even though JRE 8 is installed on my MAC -" No Java Runtime present,requesting to install " gets displayed in terminal

ДО:
iMac:platform jocker$ /usr/libexec/java_home
The operation couldn’t be completed. Unable to locate a Java Runtime.

ПОСЛЕ:
iMac:deploy-platform jocker$ /usr/libexec/java_home
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/temurin-17.jdk/Contents/Home

mac os:
echo $JAVA_HOME
which java
$(dirname $(readlink $(which javac)))/java_home
/usr/libexec/java_home

java -XshowSettings:properties -version
java -XshowSettings:properties -version 2>&1 > /dev/null | grep 'java.home'



2021 solution
TL;DR

brew install temurin

Details

On an M1 Mac/Apple Silicon (running Big Sur), I had already openjdk installed. As signaled in a previous answer by Mohammed, openjdk is keg-only with brew, and hence requires adding a symlink.

After following this, it solved the No Java Runtime present error, but rJava was complaining about missing libjvm.dylib and that existing libraries were for the wrong architecture:

.onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'rJava', details:
  call: dyn.load(jvm, FALSE)
  error: unable to load shared object '/opt/homebrew/Cellar/openjdk/16.0.2/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home/lib/server/libjvm.dylib':
  dlopen(/opt/homebrew/Cellar/openjdk/16.0.2/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home/lib/server/libjvm.dylib, 10): 
    no suitable image found.  Did find:
    /opt/homebrew/Cellar/openjdk/16.0.2/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home/lib/server/libjvm.dylib: 
    mach-o, but wrong architecture

Installing Eclipse Temurin (previously AdoptOpenJDK) (and removing the previously created symlink in /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk.jdk) immediately solved both issues seamlessly.

Just run brew install temurin and everything should be OK.
