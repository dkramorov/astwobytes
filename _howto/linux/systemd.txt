SYSTEMD

Starting with Ubuntu 15.04, Upstart will be deprecated in favor of Systemd. With Systemd to manage the services we can do the following (through the systemctl action SERVICE pattern):

systemctl start SERVICE - Use it to start a service. Does not persist after reboot

systemctl stop SERVICE - Use it to stop a service. Does not persist after reboot

systemctl restart SERVICE - Use it to restart a service

systemctl reload SERVICE - If the service supports it, it will reload the config files related to it without interrupting any process that is using the service.

systemctl status SERVICE - Shows the status of a service. Tells whether a service is currently running.

systemctl enable SERVICE - Turns the service on, on the next reboot or on the next start event. It persists after reboot.

systemctl disable SERVICE - Turns the service off on the next reboot or on the next stop event. It persists after reboot.

systemctl is-enabled SERVICE - Check if a service is currently configured to start or not on the next reboot.

systemctl is-active SERVICE - Check if a service is currently active.

systemctl show SERVICE - Show all the information about the service.

sudo systemctl mask SERVICE - Completely disable a service by linking it to /dev/null; you cannot start the service manually or enable the service.

sudo systemctl unmask SERVICE - Removes the link to /dev/null and restores the ability to enable and or manually start the service.
