HOWTO: recover lost partition after unexpected shutdown (Lucid)

    Two days ago "someone" took out brutally (but without intention) the power supply of my box; when I reboot the machine I've got this message just after the Grub was loaded:
    Code:

    No init found. Try passing init= boot arg
    BusyBox v1.10.2 (Ubuntu 1:1.10.2.2ubuntu7) built-in shell (ash)

    Mmm, I've never seen this, but I quickly understood that my box was seriously damaged, the access to my data was impossible; user in panic

    After two days of trying to fix the issue I've been able to get back my disk intact; I know, I'm a pretty lucky folk.

    First to all this "guide" worked for me and for my case; for what I've understood the problem was regarding something about EXT4 filesystem that was locking the access to the disk due to the unexpected shutdown (of course); Grub was ok, hardware disk was ok; I'm not so deep involved in the knowledge of the filesystem stuff, but I had the high suspect that the inode structure was denying the system to be mounted/accessed for some pending operations.

    At this moment I've created a USB key with the live of Ubuntu Rescue Remix http://ubuntu-rescue-remix.org/ and I booted the machine with this distro.

    As a first step I've just list my partitions (sda in my case it's the only drive):
    Code:

    sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda

    Disk /dev/sda: 250.1 GB, 250059350016 bytes
    255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 30401 cylinders
    Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes
    Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
    I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
    Disk identifier: 0x000619b6

       Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
    /dev/sda1   *           1       29844   239721898+  83  Linux
    /dev/sda2           29845       30401     4474102+   5  Extended
    /dev/sda5           29845       30401     4474071   82  Linux swap / Solaris

    The damaged partition, in my case, was /dev/sda1.
    Now I've tried to do an fsck:
    Code:

    sudo fsck -yv /dev/sda1

    but
    Code:

    fsck: Device or resource busy while trying to open /dev/sda1
    Filesystem mounted or opened exclusively by another program?

    What? The disk was obviously not mounted (although I did an umount); no way, I was not able to do an fsck on that partition.

    I've tried everything:

        Create an image with dd and mount the image after an fsck (the image was unusable due to an arror in the filesystem)
        Back-up the partition with PhotoRec (the files saved were really trivial)
        Mount the disk as slave (the Ubuntu Rescue freezed trying to mount it)


    I've was almost to give up and prepare myself to format the disk, when I came across this technical document (for EXT3)
    http://planet.admon.org/using-altern...to-check-ext3/
    So I decided to try it as last resource (remove the first inode), based on consideration that all my data was already lost.
    Code:

    sudo debugfs -w /dev/sda1
    debugfs 1.41.11 (14-Mar-2010)
    debugfs:  clri <8>
    debugfs:  quit

    Then I've launch fsck:
    Code:

    sudo fsck -yv /dev/sda1

    but
    Code:

    fsck: Device or resource busy while trying to open /dev/sda1
    Filesystem mounted or opened exclusively by another program?

    Damn! No way; but I was thinking that maybe a reboot (*) was needed.
    (*) to reboot with Ubuntu Rescue I've used ALT+PrnScreen+r+e+i+s+u+b instead of normal reboot because the normal reboot was not working

    Then I've launch fsck again:
    Code:

    sudo fsck -yv /dev/sda1

    and now this time worked!
    Fsck fix the filesystem errors; I've had not need to do a tune2fs as stated in the document reported above for the re-creation of the journalized filesystem.

    Rebooted the machine with my disk and everything is all there.
    Happy user.
