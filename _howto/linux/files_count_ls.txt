To determine how many files there are in the current directory, put in ls -1 | wc -l


For example, to find all files in the current directory that have been modified since yesterday (24 hours ago) use:

find . -maxdepth 1 -mtime -1

Note that to find files modified before 24 hours ago, you have to use -mtime +1 instead of -mtime -1.
