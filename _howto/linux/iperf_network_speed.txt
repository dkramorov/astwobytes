iPerf is designed to do exactly that and it is cross-platform. Download the version for your OS.

On one of the computers run 

iperf -s (this is the server)

and on the other run

iperf -c <server hostname or IP> (this is the client).

Then wait for the results. There are many options to tweak the measuring. Check iperf -hfor a complete list of options.
