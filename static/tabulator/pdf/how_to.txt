Oli: you are the best. I love working with tabulator and I'm happy to help on smaller problems with dependencies. Of course I've already spend some funds on Patreon ;-)
For all who are struggling with UTF-8 in Table-Headers, using tabulator and jsPDF with autoTable;
this solution works:
( I tried several fonts, good results are given with WorkSans from Google Fonts
https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans?selection.family=Work+Sans&sidebar.open
OpenFont License. Big thanks to Wei Huang!)

    generate a font-file with fontconverter.html from jsPDF-master\jsPDF-master\fontconverter (I've uploaded 'WorkSans-Regular.ttf')
    load font-file after jspdf and before autotable :

<script src="assets/js/tabulator.min.js"></script>
<script src="assets/js/jspdf.min.js"}></script>

<script src="assets/js/WorkSans-Regular-normal.js"></script>
<script src="assets/js/jspdf.plugin.autotable.min.js"></script>

3) set-up PDF-Download:

function downloadPDF() {
    tabulator.download("pdf", "Output.pdf", {
        orientation: "l", //set page orientation to landscape
        title: "Report", //add title to report
        jsPDF: {
            unit: "mm", //set units to mm
            format: [420, 297], // A3
        },
        autoTable: function (doc) {
            doc.addFont('WorkSans-Regular-normal.ttf', 'WorkSans-Regular', 'bold');
            doc.setFont("WorkSans-Regular", 'bold'); // set font->important: use bold instead of normal , as it is in header, body text stays normal
            doc.setFontSize(10);
            return {
                styles: {
                    font: "WorkSans-Regular",
                    fontStyle: "bold", ->important: use bold instead of normal , as it is in header, body text stays normal
                    fontSize: 10,
                },
                theme: 'striped',
                margin: { top: 35 },
            }
        }
    });
}

Done.
